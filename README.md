# Personal Dashboard

Personal Dashboard is a monorepo for spend awareness, reward optimization, and agent-driven follow-up. It is designed to integrate with Hermes for fast transaction alerts and OpenClaw for recommendations, tasks, and operational workflows.

The first version is runnable with local fixtures. It models the dashboard you described: fast bank-email signals, slow source-of-truth transaction state, reward calculations, suspicious charge alerts, and OpenClaw actions in one place.

## What Is Included

- `apps/api`: local JSON API and future integration webhook receiver.
- `apps/web`: dashboard UI served from a separate local web port.
- `packages/contracts`: shared dashboard contract builders.
- `packages/integrations`: Hermes and OpenClaw adapter boundaries.
- `packages/fixtures`: realistic development data.
- `scripts/`: Conductor-aware worktree ports, dev launch, archive, stop, and smoke-test scripts.

## Quick Start

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts --minimum-release-age=604800
scripts/dev.sh
```

Then open the dashboard URL printed by the dev script.

## Verify

```sh
bun test
bun run smoke
bun run check
```
